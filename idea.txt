Train a dynamic gaussian splat frame by frame

-- Base idea --
First frame:
- Read first frame dataset only
- Train a vanilla 3dgs
- Save ply

For the rest:
- Load previous ply
- Load current dataset
- Deform previous ply to current dataset points (scene.py -> gaussian_model.py)
- Train for fewer iterations

-- Extensions --
- Optical flow loss
- Temporal coherence loss

Current problems:
1. Accumulation: Each new stage keeps adding new gaussians
2. Under reconstruction: Gaussians keep getting added to the environment instead of dynamic areas, ending up under reconstructed

Proposed changes:
- Motion segmentation, allow for densification only on those areas
- Add only inside the bounds
- Save the added gaussians separately
